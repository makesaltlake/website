After several months of searching, moving, cleaning, and more moving, we're done! EnjiGo is now in the warehouse behind Standard Supply, 3424 South Main St.

We're still settling in, but the laser cutter is running and we have door access for members. The wood shop is not yet operational, and the CNC routers and 3D printers are still being set up.

A big thanks to everyone who helped in this transition. We couldn't have done it without you! We're excited to be in the same building as Standard Supply, too--there is a lot of synergy between what makers do and what Standard sells. More good things are coming.
